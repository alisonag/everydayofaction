# Every Day of Action
This tool was built as part of an effort to organize actions every day across the world for NoDAPL. These events were submitted through ActionNetwork, but AN did not have a calendar view so this was meant to fill that gap. 

The website is no longer live but I've abstracted some of the code here so it can be used on other campaigns. Be warned that this was built over the span of a few weeknights so it's fairly scrappy.

# Setting up the Calendar

Note: All fields that need replacing to customize the calendar to a different campaign have the word `placeholder`

## API Key and Event Campaign URI

You'll need the Action Network API key for the account that created the campaign. Once you have that, you'll need to figure out the campaign's URI by querying the API's `event_campaign` endpoint. More about that here: https://actionnetwork.org/docs/v2/event_campaigns

The calendar needs a path that looks something like this: https://actionnetwork.org/api/v2/event_campaigns/d91b4b2e-ae0e-4cd3-9ed7-d0ec501b0bc3/events

Once you have the API key and the event campaign URI, add these to the [events.php](action-network/events.php) and [actionnetwork.class.php](action-network/actionnetwork.class.php) files.

## Getting data from the API

Next you'll need to use the events.php scrip to generate the json file of data. You can do this by running the [events.php](action-network/events.php) script from the command line to test it out. 

To get the calendar to update itself automatically you'll need to set up a cron job. You can use the bash script [update_events](update-events). You'll want to modify this bash script to match your server/directory structure. Currently this bash script also backs up the json for up to 7 days. You'll want a cron job for this in order to stay under the API's rate-limits and reduce strain on the server.

Ultimately this json file needs to live in the same directory as the HTML page.

## Viewing the calendar

Once the json file has all your data, ensure that it is in the same directory as [index.html](public_html/index.html) and open the html file in your browser. You'll want to customize the meta-data, title, description, and "add event" url. Search for the word `placeholder` to find all the places that need customizing.
